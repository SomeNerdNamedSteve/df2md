# DialogFlow to Markdown
This project is simply used to read the intents, utterances, and text-based responses from a Dialogflow chatbot.

## Dependencies
- Python 3 (I used 3.5.2) can be downloaded [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Steps to run
- Clone the Repo
- create a folder named `chatbot-intents`
- Place all of your intent and utterance JSON files in the `chatbot-intents` folder
- Go to the root project directory
- Run the program by typing `python main.py`. A markdown file name `intent.md` will be generated.
